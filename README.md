# directory_search
API that runs over paths in your computer and detects old, big, not used and duplicated files

Status:
- Gives an output of old and unused files
- Need to implement duplication detection algorithm (by file size? read bytes into byte[] and compare? tried to do the later, worked nicely but not sure...)
- Thymeleaf it all
